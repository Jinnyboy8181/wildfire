problem:
Due to global warming there was a increase of wildfires and nature cannot regenerate fast enough so humans step in but we cannot arrive fast enough before half of the forest
is burned down so i decided to make this programto predict fires

Data:
 I found my  dataset in kaggle about wildfires in California the dataset set included variables like max/min temp, wind speed, etc...

 Approach:
 my appraoch is by trying 3 different classifications to test all 3 to see which works the best
